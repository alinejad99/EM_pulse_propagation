Pulse Propagation Modeling in Waveguides
This repository presents a Python project for modeling the propagation of a square-modulated pulse in a waveguide. Let's assume that a square-modulated pulse with a carrier frequency of 10 Hz (f_c) and a time duration of 10 seconds (τ) is propagating in a 90-degree waveguide.

A. Pulse Shape Calculation
Task 1: Calculate the Pulse Shape
Calculate the pulse shape in the time domain using the given carrier frequency (f_c) and time duration (τ) of the pulse.
Determine how long it takes for the pulse shape to change and lose its information content.
B. Gaussian Pulse Modeling
Task 2: Modeling a Gaussian Pulse
Assume that the pulse is Gaussian in shape with a pulse width of 0.1 seconds (τ_0).
Determine the pulse's bandwidth (spread) using Matlab software or any suitable tool.
Compare the calculated pulse width with theoretical expectations.
Gaussian Pulse Equation
The Gaussian pulse equation is given as:

𝐴(𝑡) = 𝑒^(𝑗𝜔_0𝑡) * 𝑒^(-𝑡^2 / 𝜏_0^2)

Where:

A(t) is the pulse envelope as a function of time (t).
ω_0 is the angular frequency.
τ_0 is the pulse width.
Please follow the instructions in the repository to perform the calculations and analysis for the square-modulated pulse and Gaussian pulse modeling. You can adapt the code and parameters as needed for your specific waveguide and pulse characteristics.

Enjoy exploring and simulating pulse propagation in waveguides!
